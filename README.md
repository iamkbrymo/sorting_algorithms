# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
A project by Buraimoh Michael and Opeyemi Olatunji

In this project, I implemented several different sorting algorithms.

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files. 

## Helper Files :raised_hands:

* [print_array.c](./print_array.c): C function that prints an array of integers. 
* [print_list.c](./print_list.c): C function that prints a `listint_t` doubly-linked list. 

## Header Files :file_folder:

* [sort.h](./sort.h): Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions written for the project.
